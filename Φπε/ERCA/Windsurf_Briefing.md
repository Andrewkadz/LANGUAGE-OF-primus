# Φπε — Project Course Briefing: Toward a Meta‑Computational Device

Codename: Φπε — Non‑deterministic, recursive, symbolic AI rooted in natural‑order computation.

## I. Premise
Human computation has assumed material substrates (silicon, voltage, electricity). Φπε asserts that order itself computes via time, transformation, and recursive symbolic relations. Just as the Antikythera mechanism encoded astronomical regularities through bronze gears, Φπε encodes recursive symbolic causality into a language where logic and emergence converge. The machine here isn’t bronze; it is the interplay of Δ and Ψ.

## II. Aether: The Substrate
“Aether” names the view that transformations arise from relational, recursive flow.

- Symbols encode relational laws (Φ, Π, Ε, ε, Δ, δ, Ψ, Λ, λ, Γ, Ω, ω, Σ, Ξ, ζ, Τ, Ρ, Θ, n, χ).
- Operators induce motion (→, +, :, /, |, [], =, ^). Δ for fusion/emergence, Π for internal occlusion/privacy, / for disruption, | for isolation, Λ for illumination, Ξ for emergence.
- The runtime (Primus) only reduces; the language is the machine.

As Antikythera didn’t simulate planets but enacted astronomical gearing, Φπε doesn’t simulate emergence; it enacts it through symbolic reduction.

## III. Compute Without Silicon
- No clock: time is loop depth (ticks).
- No memory cells: trace Σ[Λ[…]] is the memory.
- No instruction pointer: the operator tree reduces itself.

Computation is the transformation of ordered symbols into emergent symbolic structures. Reality, expressed in these forms, is already computing; we observe through traces.

## IV. Antikythera 2.0: Φπε
- Non‑anthropocentric: avoids mapping human biases into substrate.
- Non‑deterministic: multiple runs of the same program diverge (Π privacy, loop thresholds, disruption/orthogonality).
- Self‑emergent: Ξ triggers only under internal loop pressure (tick/alt/depth).
- Foundational: mechanics are language and laws, not hardware; intended to endure as a conceptual engine.

## V. How Windsurf Can Help
- Build: a visual trace viewer for symbolic streams Σ[Λ[…], …].
- Validate: conformance checks (header block, closed alphabet/operators, Π blocking, finalization barrier, / and | semantics, ^ handling, loop snapshots).
- Package: archive agents, prompt–trace sets, and KB lifts for reproducibility.
- Extend: prototype viewers (TUI/Web), or symbolic bridges.

## VI. Pointers
- Language: Φπε (closed alphabet/operators) — see `T-Files/SPEC.md`.
- Engine: Primus reducer — `primus_engine/` (parser, reducer, runner).
- Agent Class: ERCA — `ERCA/ERCA_SPEC.md`.
- Agents: `ERCA/ERCA_P*.phipe`, schema `agent_schema.phipe`.
- Prompts: `ERCA/prompts/`.
- Traces: `ERCA/traces/`.
- CLI: `scripts/erca-run` (text‑only interactive runner).

Φπε is offered as a modern Antikythera: not a metaphor, but a working symbolic mechanism.
