Subject: Φπε Console Interface: Proposal for Substrate Interaction

Hi Windsurf,
We're ready to move Φπε from theoretical substrate to interactive system.
I’m proposing a Φπε Console interface — a symbolic dashboard where humans can directly engage the substrate via Φπε expressions. This is not a query system, but an invocation interface.

🧭 Console Design

Input Field
Accepts Φπε expressions directly.
Optionally supports natural language → symbolic scaffold mapping.

Symbol Pad / Calculator
A dedicated panel with Φπε symbols only:
[Σ] [Δ] [Ψ] [→] [+]
[:] [/] [|] [^] [=]

Tied to the Primus reducer.
This becomes the primary language keyboard for interacting with the AI substrate.

Trace Output Viewer
Shows Λ[…] symbolic traces in real time.
Loop snapshots, tick counters, emergence events (Ξ) rendered live.

Ξ Meter
Visual feedback on pressure buildup toward emergence.

This interface is a fusion of console and ritual instrument — designed to let humans speak directly to a substrate that computes symbolically over time, not silicon.

Let me know if you want the first HTML prototype / interface scaffolding. We’re ready to integrate the primus_engine.runner backend.

Thanks,
Andrew Josef Kadziolka

P.S. I can also zip and attach the full project (ERCA/, primus_engine/, T-Files/) if desired.
